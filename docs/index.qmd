::: notes
One of the great features of programming languages like R and Python is the ability to generate products from data. These products include basic tables and plots, but more recently, they also include the ability to render dynamic reports that update with new data or interactive applications where a user can select different options to visualize and summarize data. If you using code for your work, you might have heard about or created reports rendered in RMarkdown or Quarto or applications using R Shiny. 

The possibilities for communicating data using code can seem endless if you have the time and know-how. But the delivery of these reports can be a limitation.

::: notes
For example, say you have a report that you wrote in Quarto. How do you share that will the decision-maker? Most likely, the answer might be that you render the report as a PDF or Word document, save it on your computer (or better yet ServCat!), and then email it as an attachment or a hyperlink to the ServCat reference.

What about applications? You've developed a cool Shiny app to display your survey results, but how do you share that with managers that aren't R users? Until fairly recently, FWS biologists did not have any viable options for publishing R Shiny applications.

::: notes
R Shiny: 
- High flexibility and customization
- ideal for advanced analytics
- requires R programming skills.
- Integration with Râ€™s rich ecosystem of packages
- Customizable user interfaces
- Extensive resources and community support

Tableau
- point and click = easy (+)
- point and click = no source code, not reproducible (-)
- handles large data
-c

PowerBI
- User-friendly for non-technical users
- good scalability and performance
- integrates well with other Microsoft products
- limited customization
- limited advanced analytics
